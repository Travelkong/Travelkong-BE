# Travelkong-BE-testing
Testing repo for Travelkong-BE since the code from the original repo tried to pander to the Repository Pattern, which abstracts a lot of stuff that makes it so I, the core maintainer of that repo, couldn't comprehend what's going on with my code anymore (lol).
I might make this the offical repo when it is "matured" enough.

The codebase is a mess, and I will refactor it laterâ„¢.
